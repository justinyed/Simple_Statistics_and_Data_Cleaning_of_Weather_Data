# w4-Stats-and-Data-Cleaning

## Exercise 1: Descriptive Statistics 
- [x] Convert all lists to numpy arrays and use numpy to conditionally select elements
  - `temp[ dates < np.datetime64('2019- 09-07T00:00’)]`
- [x] Get temperature high and low for each day (Print it nicely like a weather report) 
- [x] Plot Mean w/standard deviation for the y error bars by day of week
- [x] Create a 1-dimensional histogram of:
  - Use subplots to put two plots in the same figure if needed.
  - [x] All variables for the entire week (one for each)
  - [x] All variables for the day that the hurricane passed through (one for each)


## Exercise 2: Data Wrangling

- [ ] For data wrangling/munging practice:
- [ ] Write code that duplicates the files I included in W3 from the original 2019dbase.csv file from
  - https://www.jlab.org/fm/wx/ • https://www.jlab.org/fm/wx/VWS/data/
  - Note: The header file csv_column_headers.csv
- [ ] Find at least 5 other variables that you find interesting in the data set and perform a descriptive analysis on
  them w/plots!
  - [ ] Extra: Is it possible to calculate the rainfall by month?
- [ ] What did you have to do to wrangle the data into a reasonable dataset?
